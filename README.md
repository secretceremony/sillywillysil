# Silly Willy Sil's Portfolio Website

## About

This is a simple three-page static website serving as my online portfolio. It showcases my work, provides information about me, and details commission options.

## Technologies Used

* **Vite:** A fast build tool for frontend development.
* **Vue.js:** The progressive JavaScript framework used for building the user interface.
* **Vuetify:** A complete UI framework for Vue.js, used for styling and components.
* **EmailJS:** Used for handling the contact form submissions directly from the client side.

## How to Run Locally

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/secretceremony/sillywillysil
    ```

    ```bash
    cd sillywillysil
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    or if you use Yarn:

4.  **Run the development server:**
