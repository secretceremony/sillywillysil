      <h3 class="text-h6 mb-4">Terms of Service (TOS) for Commissions</h3>
      <p>By commissioning me, you agree to the following terms:</p>

      <h4>Payment:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">I accept payment in <strong>USD through Paypal/Ko-fi</strong> and <strong>IDR through QRIS</strong>.</li>
        <li class="mb-2"><strong>Full payment is due after settling on the sketch.</strong> I will proceed with the commission after receiving payment.</li>
        <li>Payment plans can be discussed upon request.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Guidelines and Process:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">I reserve the right to decline any commission request for any reason.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">Please provide clear visual references and pose details to avoid misunderstandings. Quality over quantity; no pressure to make multiple offers.</li>
        <li>Additional fees may apply for complex designs/prompts. This will be discussed and agreed upon before payment.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Revisions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">Revisions are allowed during the sketching/lineart stage. <strong>Up to 3 major revisions</strong> are permitted after agreement on the initial sketch.</li>
        <li>Major revisions (e.g., significant pose or design alterations) cannot be accepted once the coloring/shading process begins.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Cancellation and Refunds:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">If I have to cancel the commission due to unforeseen circumstances on my end, you will receive a full refund.</li>
        <li>If you wish to cancel after work has begun, the refund amount will depend on the stage of completion (e.g., partial refund if only sketch is done, no refund if coloring has started). This will be handled on a case-by-case basis.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Delivery and Completion:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">Commissions will be delivered via <strong>Discord, Email, or Google Drive</strong> as requested by the client.</li>
        <li>Completion time typically ranges between <strong>1â€“2 months</strong>, subject to workload and real-life circumstances. I will keep you updated on progress.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Blacklisting and Breach of Terms:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">I reserve the right to blacklist users who violate my TOS, commit chargebacks, or harass me.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">If blacklisted, you may lose ownership rights to the commissioned work, and further transactions will be refused.</li>
        <li>Respectful communication is required at all times.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Disclaimer:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>I am not responsible for how commissioned art is used once delivered, as long as it complies with my Terms of Use (TOU).</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mt-6 font-weight-bold">
        If you have read my TOS, please include <strong>"sakayume"</strong> when contacting me about a commission!
