      <h3 class="text-h6 mb-4">Terms of Use (TOU) for Commissioned Artwork</h3>
      <p>These terms outline how you may use the commissioned artwork you receive.</p>

      <h4>Usage Rights (Personal Use):</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">Prices are for **personal use only**. Commercial use is prohibited unless a separate commercial license is purchased.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">You may upload my commission with **proper credits** to my Toyhouse profile (both onsite and offsite). Please refrain from claiming my design/artwork as your own.</li>
        <li class="mb-2">You may use the artwork as a profile picture, banner, or print it for personal, non-commercial display.</li>
          <li>By default, all commissions are displayed as samples in my portfolio and social media. If you prefer your commission **not to be published**, please let me know in advance!</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="mt-4">Restrictions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li class="mb-2">Please **do not edit my art without my permission!** If you'd like any minor changes, feel free to ask â€“ I don't mind!</li>
          <li class="mb-2">When using designs I created (either as commissions or adopts), please remember to **keep the original design visible** on the character's profile (if applicable, like on Toyhouse). Avoid excessive lightening of the skin tone unless it's intentionally left pure white.</li>
          <li class="mb-2">Please refrain from making an **exact copy of my design**. However, you may create twins or children based on them or an AU (Alternate Universe) version.</li>
        <li>You may **not** turn my design into an existing or a new Open/Closed Species. Please notify me if you intend to do so.</li>
        <li>Commercial use (selling merchandise, using for business promotion, etc.) is **strictly prohibited** unless a separate commercial license is purchased and agreed upon.</li>
          <li>Do not remove my signature from the artwork.</li>
      </ul>

        <h4 class="mt-4">Commercial Use Inquiries:</h4>
        <p>If you are interested in using the commissioned artwork for commercial purposes, please contact me to discuss purchasing a commercial license. Terms and fees for commercial use will be negotiated based on the scope.</p>
